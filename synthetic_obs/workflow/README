Rocoto Workflow to Create Simulated Obs

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Cron

It's easiest to run this workflow using cron so that rocotorun is executed every _X_ minutes. To
edit your crontab, use the following command in your home direcory:

`crontab -e`

The following two lines should be at the beginning of your crontab to insure than code runs properly 
and that you are emailed with error messages:

```
#!/bin/sh --login
MAILTO=email@noaa.gov
```

Add the following line to run the workflow every 15 minutes:

`*/15 * * * * /path/to/workflow/run_rocoto.sh`

Brief Workflow Descriptions

perfect_ob_workflow.xml = Used to create simulated "perfect" (i.e., pure interpolation, no added 
                          errors) using rap, rap_e, and rap_p prepBUFR files. These are the obs
                          actually used in the OSSE.

sfc_stat_ob_workflow.xml = Used to create simulated surface stations obs using data downloaded from
                           the IEM and converted into the prepBUFR CSV format. These prepBUFRs have
                           the "sfc" tag. These obs are only used to the surface station NR 
                           evaluation.
