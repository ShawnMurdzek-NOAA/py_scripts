Rocoto Workflow to Create Simulated Obs

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Using Cron

It's easiest to run this workflow using cron so that rocotorun is executed every _X_ minutes. To
edit your crontab, use the following command in your home direcory:

`crontab -e`

The following two lines should be at the beginning of your crontab to insure than code runs properly 
and that you are emailed with error messages:

```
#!/bin/sh --login
MAILTO=email@noaa.gov
```

Add the following line to run the workflow every 15 minutes:

`*/15 * * * * /path/to/workflow/run_rocoto.sh`
