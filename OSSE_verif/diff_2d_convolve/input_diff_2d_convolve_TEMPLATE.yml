# Model information
# Notes:
#     - For the files, the following placeholders can be used:
#         {iYYYY} = Initialization year
#         {iMM} = Initialization month
#         {iDD} = Initialization day
#         {iHH} = Initialization hour
#         {vYYYY} = Valid year
#         {vMM} = Valid month
#         {vDD} = Valid day
#         {vHH} = Valid hour
#         {FFF} = Forecast hour
#     - For init_time, specify the start and end of the range, as well as the step in hours 
#     - If computing RMSD differences between two forecast hours (rmsd_fhr_diff = True), then
#         fcst_hr must have exactly two entries

# Field information
# Notes:
#     - "binary" refers to setting all values > binary_val to 1 and all other values to 0. This can
#         be useful when trying to see differences around a particular threshold (e.g., ceilings 
#         near 500 ft)
#     - In addition to UPP output, the following fields are supported:
#         * WSPD: Wind speed
#         * WDIR: Wind direction
#         * CEIL: Cloud ceiling AGL (using ceil_name, which is one of the ceiling names outpu by
#             uppp.compute_ceil_agl())
field:
  name: '{FIELD_NAME}'
  level: 0
  ceil_name: 'CEIL_EXP2'
  binary: {BINARY}
  binary_val: {BINARY_VAL}

# Convolution information
# Notes:
#     - subset: This allows the user to only keep every nth value from the convolution. Can be
#         helpful for excluding overlapping windows.
convolve:
  size: 100
  subset: 50
